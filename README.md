#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software enginnering refers to the systematic process whereby software engineers use engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Software engineering helps in the creation of software applications and systems that are used in various aspects of today's life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**The development of programming languages:** several programming languages such as ALGOL, Pascal, and C++ have been developed in the evolution of software engineering.

**The establishment of software engineering as a discipline:** software engineering was established as a distinct discipline in the late 1960s due to the need to apply enginerring principles to software development processes to improve reliability, efficiency, and maintainability.

**The rise of agile methodologies:** the rise of agile methodologies began in the 2000s with the publication of the agile manifesto authored by 17 developers.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Requirements:** This phase involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

**Design:** this phase involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interfaces.

**Implementation:** this is the phase where code is written and the software is built according to the design specifications.

**Testing:** this phase involves conducting several tests tp ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

**Deployment:*8 this is the phase where the product is released to the users and customers.

**Maintenance:** this involves providing the ongoing, update, and enhancements to the software product after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology involves sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Waterfall methodology would be appropriate for a large project with specific and unchanging requirements while Agile methodology would be appropriate when a project require flexibility and frequent revisions, especially when the requirements are expected to evolve over time.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software developer**

Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions

**Quality Assurance Engineer**

Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans

**Project Manager**

Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software products

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are important in that they enhance developer productivity by integrating various development tasks such as editing, building, testing, and debugging into a single application. An example of an IDE is Visual Studio. Version Control Systems helps streamline development processes by enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. An example of Version Control System is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some of the common challenges faced by software engineers is changing requirements during the development cycle which may lead to project delay. Anotheer major challenge is the tight deadlines which may compormise the software quality. To solve these challenges, software engineers need to adopt agile methodologies and ensure effective commuication among the team emmbers and with the customer.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves testing the different components of the software. Integration testing involves testing the interactions between the different components of the system. System testing is the testing of the entire software system as a whole while acceptance testing involves testing the entire software system againts the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. These types of testing helps identify defects in the system at early stages in development, hence leading to high-quality final software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring and refining questions and instructions to effectively communicate with generative AI models. Prompt engineering makes it possible to tell the AI models what exactly you need and how you want it presented.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Vague Prompt: **What do you know about computers?

**Clear, specific, and concise prompt: ** What is the importance of computers in a bid for businesses to expand their market reach?

The improved prompt is specific and tells the AI model that I need to know how computers can help a business expand its market reach, compared to the first prompt which is too vague.
